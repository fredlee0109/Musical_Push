<br />
<br />
<h2> How to </h2>
<ol>
<li> Q, W, E, A, S, D are on/off switch for certain beats. For optimal use, turn 3 on from (Q or A), (W or S), and (E or D) </li>
<li> R, T, Y, F, G, H trigger a key in kslider (up to 5 at a time), using rect~, tri~, saw~ to modify the sound </li>
</ol>
<br />
<br />
<h2> Notice </h2>
<ol>
	<li> IMPORTANT: Make sure not to scroll around while it is playing. The software's multithreading is not that powerful! </li>
	<li> Sometimes, keyboard don't work correctly. Restart Max, and it should work fine </li>
</ol>
